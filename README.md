faking live experience

-   pretend there is live wire browser - server . we can interact with server
-   under the hood :
    -   request to server and comming back

-   put into class

â€‹ inside blade file -> turn code into blade directive

```php
        @livewire(App\Http\Livewire\Counter::class)
```

```php
Blade::directive('livewire', function ($expression) {
    return "<?php echo (new App\Livewire)->initialRender({$expression});?>";
});
